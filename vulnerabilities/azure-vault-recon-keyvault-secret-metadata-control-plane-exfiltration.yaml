summary: |
  Azure Key Vault enforces a separation between the Control Plane (management) and Data Plane (secrets access). However, a flaw in this isolation allowed unauthorized users to enumerate secrets and keys within a vault.
  By having Reader or lesser privileges on a Key Vault, an attacker could leverage Azure Resource Explorer to access metadata about stored secrets. This was due to unintended exposure through the Control Plane, which should not have provided insight into Data Plane resources.
  The root cause of this issue was insufficient isolation between the two planes, where metadata retrieval was permitted even when direct access to secrets was restricted. This allowed attackers to gain intelligence on sensitive assets without full permissions.
manualRemediation: |
  Reduce scope and usage of Reader. Assign it via PIM for JIT rather than standing Access. Consider creation of custom roles instead of Reader.
detectionMethods: Sentinel or similar SIEM detection rule using AzureDiagnostics logs.

summary: |
    Azure iPaaS services, such as Logic Apps, separate the Control Plane (management) from the Data Plane (execution), but a flaw in this model enabled undetectable data harvesting.
    An attacker with Azure Reader access to workflow run history could silently extract sensitive data from executions, including secrets and API responses. This was possible because execution details were exposed via the Control Plane, bypassing Data Plane access controls.
    The root cause of this issue was the unintended exposure of runtime data through metadata endpoints, allowing attackers to passively collect information without triggering alerts or requiring direct execution privileges.
manualRemediation: |
  Reduce scope and usage of Reader. Assign it via PIM for JIT rather than standing Access. Consider creation of custom roles instead of Reader.
detectionMethods: Undetectable since Microsoft confirmed they don't make the required logs available to customers.
